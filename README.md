# GKI2026

GKI2026 is a collection of small AI/ML challenge projects used in the competition. Each subfolder contains a self-contained task, example model code and the minimal scripts needed to run or validate submissions.

Repository layout (top-level):
- `golden_plate_on_thingvellir_NLP/` — next-byte prediction NLP challenge (dataset tools, training, submission helpers)
- `habitat_classification/` — image classification task with model and utils
- `hierarchical_time_series_forecasting/` — time-series forecasting challenge
- `submission/` or task-specific `submission/` folders — example `model.py` and submission templates

Quick start: open a task folder, read its `README.md`, then follow the task-specific instructions (dataset creation, training, `create_submission.py`, and `check_submission.py`).
